## 🎯 What ArchGen Solves

**The Problem:** Translating vague business requirements into technical architectures is time-consuming, error-prone, and often misaligned with budget constraints. Startups, students, and professionals struggle to:
- Convert business needs into technical specifications
- Design scalable architectures within budget limits
- Generate visual documentation for stakeholders
- Validate technical decisions early in the project lifecycle

**The Solution:** ArchGen automates early-stage system design by combining AI reasoning with business logic, producing:
- ✅ **Visual Architecture Diagrams** (System, Business, Technical views)
- ✅ **Budget-Aligned Solutions** with cost estimates
- ✅ **Deployment Strategies** and infrastructure recommendations
- ✅ **Requirements Analysis** with categorization and priority mapping

## 🎯 Use Cases & Examples

### **Startup MVP Planning**
**Input:** "E-commerce platform for 1000 users, $200/month budget"
**Output:** Serverless architecture with AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3
**Result:** ~$180/month estimated cost

### **Enterprise Application**
**Input:** "Global SaaS platform, 100k users, high availability"
**Output:** Multi-region deployment with CDN, load balancers, auto-scaling
**Result:** Comprehensive architecture with disaster recovery

### **Academic Project**
**Input:** "Student management system, university scale"
**Output:** Traditional 3-tier architecture with PostgreSQL, Spring Boot, React
**Result:** Deployment-ready configuration

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm (using npm for this repo)
- Google Gemini API key (get from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

## Environment Setup

1. **Copy the environment template:**
```bash
cp architecture-platform/.env.example architecture-platform/.env
```

2. **Configure your API key:**
Edit `architecture-platform/.env` and replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual Google Gemini API key.

⚠️ **Security Note:** Never commit your `.env` file with actual API keys to version control!

## Install
```bash
cd architecture-platform
npm install
```

## Development
```bash
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Project Structure
- `architecture-platform/` – Next.js app (app router)
- `architecture-platform/app/` – routes and APIs
- `architecture-platform/components/` – UI components

## Environment Variables

**Required:**
- `API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key for AI architecture generation

**Optional:**
- `NODE_ENV` - Development environment (defaults to 'development')
