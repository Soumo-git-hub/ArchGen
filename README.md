## 🎯 What ArchGen Solves

**The Problem:** Translating vague business requirements into technical architectures is time-consuming, error-prone, and often misaligned with budget constraints. Startups, students, and professionals struggle to:
- Convert business needs into technical specifications
- Design scalable architectures within budget limits
- Generate visual documentation for stakeholders
- Validate technical decisions early in the project lifecycle

**The Solution:** ArchGen automates early-stage system design by combining AI reasoning with business logic, producing:
- ✅ **Visual Architecture Diagrams** (System, Business, Technical views)
